The Island
====

##Concept

You are a wrongly convicted felon on a prison colony, there are three possible directions that a player can take the game.

1. Join "The Community", these are a group of convicts who recognise the power of the masses and are working together to make the best of a bad thing.
2. Join "The Tumultus", a group of convicts who survive by attacking and killing The Community.
3. Go it alone, there are resources to allow you to survive on your own, but you do not have the protection of a group and will not be trusted by either.
